# Spotlight

This project was created as a proof of concept for MacOS `Spotlight` like
functionality in any app. The idea behind it is you could fuzzy search all
ActionButtons on a page as well as some global actions that exist on all pages
and interact with them indirectly

# What I might change retrospectively if I was ever to use it in an actual project

1. I would probably change the way the opening and closing works (how the
   keybinding to open spotlight works) to something similar to [this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spotlight-react)
2. Pass keybindings like [this](https://craig.is/killing/mice)
3. I would also probably allow ActionButtons to have there own keybindings
   (shortcuts) with tooltips in the Spotlight menu similar to [this](https://github.com/saharmor/react-super-cmd)
